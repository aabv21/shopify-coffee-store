 * holds) alone otherwise. No credential data crosses this directory: `setup-credentials.ts`
 * streams credentials into the `n8n` container over stdin and reads the existing-credentials
 * export back over stdout, entirely inside the container's own `/tmp`. The directory serves only
 * `pnpm run export` (`export-workflows.ts` writes its output under `.n8n-import/export`,
 * recreating that one subdirectory itself with `mkdirSync`, which defaults to 0755) — `import:
 * workflow` reads from the separate `./workflows:/workflows` mount, not this directory. This is a
 * safety net so the directory itself exists, at the stricter local default mode, before anything
 * else touches it.
 *
 * On Linux, the bind mount only works when the host uid matches n8n's container uid (1000),
 * because n8n writes into a directory the host creates at 0700 — this function's own mode. A CI
 * runner whose uid differs would create the directory but still be unable to read back what n8n
 * writes into it; CI avoids the problem entirely by never using this bind mount for credentials.
